  1. Change makers generate confidence
    - Confidence is a habit. Make it so habitual with practice that it becomes unconscious of your style of living.
  2. Study the alchemy
  3. Flow with the seasons
    - Everything happens as God's command and to believe truthfully in it with full dedication is the final call
    - Avoid listening to things which degrades you
    - Start reading auto-biography of successful people
  4. Understand that the brain has a natural negativity bias
    - Brain looks towards negative things rather than positive things in a person or thing
    - Focus on the positive aspects and be grateful for having it in your life.
