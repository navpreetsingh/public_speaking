1. Boring content? No problem. Ask this question
  - Jerry Seinfield is able to turn around any mundane boring topic interesting and funny.

2. Start with frustration and pain points
  - Have a problem, exaggerate it with frustration and pain points
  - Seth Godin

3. Assignment: What drives you bonkers?
  - Make a list of the things that drive you nuts. If you were to explode into a rant and joyfully let off some steam about a frustrating thing (outside politics) what would it be? Do others feel the same way? What happened that made you feel this way? Was there any particular event?

    Come up with at least 3 things to make you crazy and add them to your funny story file.

    Better yet, if like Seth you have an experience like his at the airport trying to get a taxi to share. (Extra marks from the audience if you add an image to reinforce it when delivering it).

12.  Assignment: linking stories to your presentation or talk topic
  - Here we want to start to group your content and see what you can make work where.

    Assignment Instructions

    List what problem your product, service, or research solves on a general (macro) and specific (micro) level. This should be based on the next presentation topic you intend to speak on or your most recently given one. Now aim to link your presentation topic to your life stories, observations, and experiences from your funny story file.
    How can you write your story into your presentation? Are there any correlations between your topics and your stories? If you are struggling for links don’t worry. There is always a way to work funny items in. Remember, crafting an engaging story involves knowing the ending and working backwards. You want to find that funny bit and design your talk to build it in. Ken Robinson’s talk did this masterfully and he is far from alone in doing so.

    For example, say your company has a more user-friendly touch screen with bigger characters or buttons. This makes it easier for elderly people and those with vision problems to use. Cue stories about your parents or grandparents trying to use technology.

    Macro/Wider topic: It makes it easier for older people to use technology.

    Micro/Specific problem my product solves: It makes it easier for elderly people to type and use smart phones/tablets.

    Key funny to my story: My dad’s struggles with technology and specifically what he does by writing emails in the subject line.

    Set/Up intro here becomes the challenges older people have adapting to and using technology, specifically email in my case. This should be delivered in as few words as possible.

    This example is far from a classic, but it is a quick and easy joke that gets laughs:

    It’s sometimes hard for elderly people to get to grips with technology. (Relatable setup)

    My Dad (specific to me) finally tried sending email last year. He wrote me a fine long one....

    All in the subject box. (Punch line)

13.  Assignment: compare and contrast
  - Assignment Instructions

    Think of subjects that you can compare to your topic/product/research/story. To write an effective comparison and contrast, keep in mind that your subjects should be logically comparable and your composition should have a clear purpose and ideally an opportunity to add some levity.

    • Two stages of a person's life

    • Two companies, one successful one not so

    • Two places you have visited

    • Two memorable products

    • Two perspectives on the same place: past and present

    • Two candidates competing for public office

    • The rules set for you as a child and the rules you have set (or plan to set) for your own children

    • Two professional athletes

    • Two views of your parents: before and after you left home

    • Two neighbourhoods

    • Two hosts of late-night talk shows
