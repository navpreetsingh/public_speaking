6. Assignment: Your writing skills needed here
  - This is the script below as delivered by our speaker in the video above. Your task is to re write it using the techniques you've learned so far and make it more effective. Copy and paste it into an editing doc like Word to do so. Remember, brevity is levity so if you can cut words and not loose meaning always cut words. In the next section I have included one possible version for comparison.

    - Start script:

    So, thanks for having me here. It's like tough to come just after lunch. People still like rebooting eh mentally, eh but hopefully, I can get you guys eh excited with eh, with eh, what I'm about to present. So, my name is eh Fernando. People call me Fer. I'm the Global Brand VP for eh Dove eh at Unilever, has been my whole career to Unilever and I'm really proud of the work we are doing eh with this brand and I'm here to share a little bit eh of that eh with you. ehm, you know like As eh Global VP for Dove, I ended up traveling a hell of a lot. You know. Like I'm based in London, but I'm here in U.S. every six weeks or so, and eh it can be kind of tedious at times, like going to always like kinda the same place, but one of the things I really enjoy are kind of like the conversations eh that happen along the way.

    eh, and I must say that eh coming to JFK, I always have like a story to tell about the customs ehm officer. Eh When I hand him my blue Brazilian passport, eh it's always like a fun story. There was one that eh, hm, happened. I think it was like April, May this year, eh and people who follow me on Twitter and Facebook, I even posted that back then. Eh So, I arrived there, ehm gave my passport, got like the classic, "So, what brings you here?" right, And then I said, "Work. eh I come here a lot for work." And then the guy said, "And what do you do?" And I said, ehm "I work in marketing at Unilever." And then he said, "Uni what?" And then I said, "I work for Dove." And then he said, "Marketing?" And I said, "Yeah."

    And then he asked something that really surprised me. He asked me like, But why does Dove need marketing? Everyone knows Dove." No, seriously. He did really say that. And eh I laughed at first. It was kind of like a nervous laugh because I was afraid to lose my job right there for the guy like arrived in JFK, ehm, but it's not such an odd question to ask if you think about it.

    - Questions for this assignment
    How can you make this talk script more effective? Here I want you to review the transcript I provided and ask yourself what words can I cut. Where can you make it shorter and punchier. Less words with more impact. You can apply your new found comedy techniques!

    Please try yourself first before reviewing one suggested solution. Please try and rewrite it rather than outlining the techniques you might use to do so. For the script please see the text under the video in the video labelled "Instructions" prior.

      - There are many possible adjustments to the below script and many ways to squeeze in more entertainment. If you managed to shorten yours in any way, eliminate filler words, identify the key funny line and got there faster then you're on the right track!

      Setup Statements:

      I’m Brazilian, I live in London and as the Global Brand VP for Dove at Unilever, I travel a lot. It sounds fun but can be tedious at times. One of the things I really enjoy are the conversations that happen along the way.

      Main story body and setting the scene:

      A few months back I’m coming through immigration, I hand over my blue Brazilian passport and get the classic :"So, what brings you here?". I said, "Work. I come here a lot for work.". Next he says "And what do you do?" I said, ehm "I work in marketing at Unilever." he said, "Uni what?" I said, "I work for Dove." And then he said, "Marketing?" And I said, "Yeah."

      Key laugh line:

      And then he asked something that really surprised me: “why does Dove need marketing? Everyone knows Dove." I laughed at first, but it was a nervous laugh because I was afraid to lose my job.

      Transition line back to main points of the talk:

      But it's not such an odd question to ask if you think about it.

      Words: 165 vs 391 (57% less words. That's a lot in the world of public speaking!).

7. Assignment: Get writing and link your stories to topics
  - Open your funny story file, take your favourite story and write about it for 10 minutes. Don’t stop to add structure, just let the words flow as much as possible. It can be a life lesson, a cool product, things that drive you crazy, insightful information from a book you are reading, etc. Don’t focus too much on the content at this point; this is simply a writing exercise.

    Here, we want to identify what you like best, are already comfortable talking about, and are excited to tell people. We also want to find hidden details our mind might have temporarily misplaced.

    Now work to find the key point to that story. Where is the funny anecdote, interesting bit of knowledge, or the entertaining part? Work to cut out unnecessary words like you (hopefully) just did with Fernando and re-tell the best stories following the Joke Structure (i.e. Setup, Punch line, and Taglines if you have any). Don’t worry if you can’t come up with anything immediately. Often this process can take a few days or even weeks. The important thing is that you begin to think about your list of stories. Most of my best ones come to me when I am out and about —letting my subconscious do the work—rather than when I am sitting at a desk.

    Start to think about your stories as they connect to general topics and make a list of what areas they could be included under. Remember the connection can be quite loose as we saw from Ken's talk and rely on the right introduction (setup) or takeaway to make it work well in a business content that initially may seem unlikely.

    For example my list looks a bit like this:

    My Dad sending me emails all in the subject line. Technology /New Users

    Urinating on an electrical fence by accident. Market Entry (know your competitive landscape)

    Getting a job offer from a startup that told me they had no budget for me but could “buy me a few nice meals”. Maslow’s Hierchary of needs/ Compensation

    Using the Spanish word for female private parts in place of bless you with a host family for 2 whole months. Learning

    Cleaning lady who rather than help me, cleaned up around me when I had salmonella poisoning in China. Culture

    Instructing a group of snorkelers to swim with a whale shark that turned out to be a Tiger Shark (with a lot more teeth!). Experience based learning

    As a student being paid to mow lawns with no grass in Nantucket. Cost cutting /Budgeting/Inefficiency

    My Australian friend Matt calling me when he arrived in Bogota, Colombia with no Spanish and telling me he was on “calle street” (Calle means street). Learning/Training

    Until recently Ireland had more Nobel Prizes than China. A true superpower? Statistics

    Guy at my local supermarket who pronounces my name wrong every time. Customer Service/Relationships

    My mother finding me drunkenly calling my cats name out the back garden. He was dead four years at the time. Something I had forgotten. Habit

    Homeless man asking me if I had a spare sandwich. I showed no signs of eating or indeed having a sandwich at the time. Asking the right questions

    Rushing my mother to the accident and emergency ward in hospital only to be informed it was closed. Expectations/Operations/Advertising

    Ireland reports the lowest number of annual UFO sightings in Europe. Alcohol? Statistics

    Uber advertising looking for people within its corporate division with “The fear tolerance of a honey badger.” What do they plan on doing to employees? Recruitment/Culture

    Guy at the park who sat on the wall drinking beer while casting a ball to his dog via a fishing rod he had attached it to. Hacks/Invention/Strategy.
