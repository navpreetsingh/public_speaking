1. How to have awesome yet relaxed looking delivery
  - second main component **DELIVERY**

2. How to start strong
  - one thing to practice anything more is
    - First 30 seconds delivery

3. Assignment: Develop an opening
  - Assignment Instructions

    If you don't yet have a story that comes to mind try and develop a generic, but unique to you, opening line, bearing in mind the importance of the first 30 seconds of a talk. This exercise is taken from an article by best-selling author and comedy coach Judy Carter:

    Make a list of your ethnicity, parents’ nationalities, your hobbies, and your current and past professions.

    Pick two of the items you wrote and insert them into the following formula:

    “You may not know this, but I’m ______________ and _____________ (or “I’m part this and part that”), so that means I ___________________________.”

    By doing this you are seeking to identify key attributes about yourself and communicate them to the audience in a humorous manner.

    Eg. I am from Ireland and have quite a strong accent, so if I say something even mildly funny, and you don't laugh...I'm going to assume you didn't understand...and say it again.

4. How to get the best possible introduction
  - Outsource your introduction
    - tell them 3 things
    - your name should come at the last
    - Technique
      - write 3 things abount you and send it to the host/organizer in advance
      - only write your name once and ideally as the last words
      - avoid talking about your own achievements at the start

5. Assignment: Write out your intro
  - Assignment Instructions

    Now that you know your talk starts with your introduction try and write three alternate versions of varying lengths.

    For some events you often need to emphasise certain experiences over others in an effort to build rapport with your audience. Eg. if you are speaking to a group of engineers and you studied engineering but normally don't put that in your introduction, now is the time to add it.

    For example:

    Our next speaker's book has been listed as the #1 in the world on public speaking, he's taught at Oxford and Stanford University, and been featured by the likes of TED.com, Forbes and Lifehacker. All the way from (*exotic) Ireland please welcome... David Nihill.

    Our next speaker's videos have been viewed over 40million times, he's a former winner and host of the Moth story telling series, and the winner of the prestigious San Francisco International Comedy Competition...who's previous finalists include Robin Williams, Ellen DeGeneres and Dana Carvey, so he's in pretty good company. All the way from Ireland please welcome... David Nihill.

    Our next speaker is a graduate of the Michael Smurfit Graduate School of business, a bestselling writer and a regular guest lecturer at Stanford Graduate Business School and the University of Oxford. His work has been featured in the Irish Times, Irish Independent and Forbes...and he is here for us today. Please welcome David Nihill.

    *Our next speaker comes highly recommend by his own mother, a man I once met in a bar and an intoxicated penguin that comes to me in my sleep. A legend in his own underpants, please welcome....

    *Not for external unless you really hate your job ;)

6. How to control the room if it's less than ideal
  - no one applaud's on your entrance after your outsourced introduction
  - the more you talk, the higher your voice gets, the more they will talk
  - put your one hand in authoritative position by raising and stand still in silence
    - this will shame the public and they will become quiet
  - Last strategy - start clapping and the rest of the crowd will follow you. 
    - Clap for the audience
    - clap for the heroes sitting in audience
    - clap for the host and event organizer
    - clap for the other presenters

7. How to self edit your content
  - Go through your contant and use metric system to take emotion out of it
    - if people laugh, reacted, tweeted or comment on it and ask question
      - it's a Five
    - pretty good - Four
    - little decent - Three
    - don't know the section - give it a one or two
  - know that "Max human attention span is 9 mins 59 sec"
  - if you don't have a hook in that span, attention is long gone
  - always try and go shorter
  - nowadays with social networking and online shorts
    - this duration have gone to 1 minute

8. How to remove filler words (ah, ehh, but)
  - Just raise your voice will help you remove filler words

9. How to build more trust and control the room
  - get out of behind podiums
  - people need to see you to trust you
  - bring your clicker and extra clicker in case one of them stops working

10.  How to never worry about forgetting what you plan to say
  - In the world of PS, 
    - avoid, hide notes
    - this will stop the message going to audience  
      - that you are unprepared, nervous and have negative impression

11.  The secret to truly conversational presenting: The memory palace
  - Richard Cervetti (Drybar comedy)
    - simple premise he do adapted is based on the book from Joshua (Moonwalking with Einstein)
  - Need to take that story and visualize it taking place within a building or an area that we are extremely familiar with
  - take the bullet points, turn it into story and 
    - visualize it taking place within a house in a sequential order
    - this will help you remember the place where you are in the house and your next move
    - this will help you give the KEY POINT to audience without forgetting it
  - In case your presentation time is decreased significantly
    - you know your 30 seconds start
    - we have key points and how many can we strip down

12.  Quick note on using the memory palace
  - place your palace on the stage
    - behind water bottles
    - behind your phone
    - or on ground
    - somewhere where you can see it

13.  Assignment: Start your own memory palace
  - Watch this TED talk by Joshua Foer on the memory palace.
    https://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_foer_feats_of_memory_anyone_can_do?language=en

    Now craft your own memory palace. This is how to do it:
    1. Decide on a blueprint for your palace. A memory palace can be a purely imagined place but it’s often easier to base it upon a place that exists in the real world, one that you are familiar with. The house you grew up in, the apartment you’re currently living in, and your office are all great examples.

    2. Define a route through this palace. It’s essential that you follow a specific route and a specific order through your palace so you’ll log items in the order you want to speak about them.

    3. Identify specific storage locations in your palace and along your route. This will give you defined places to store your information.

    4. Memorize the memory palace. The best way to do this is by drawing out a blueprint so you can visualize it brought to life on paper and then, create a memory in your mind.

    5. Place things to be remembered in your palace. For example, if part of your presentation consists of talking about Ireland or a particular Irish guy you met (like me), do your best to create this person in as much detail as you can. This essentially, burns an image in your mind that makes it easy to recall that element. The more humorous and absurd the better.

    6. Explore your palace and see everything you have created. Visualize everything you have created and commit it to memory in your mind. Take a few moments to do this. These essentially become your practice run-throughs, in which you walk through the house and, along the way, encounter all the different memory points or key item topics for your presentation that you want to remember. If you go blank at any moment stop, and picture where you are in your memory palace.

    For me, this is the lower floor of my house with a path that takes in each room I enter from the main door (the start of my talk), past key topic areas in each room, on the sofas, on the chairs, at the table, and then exit through the door (the conclusion of my talk). Using this technique, I have never gone blank on stage.

14. What to do with your hands
  - study shows more use of hand and more visible on video
    - more likely your video is to clock up views and have some element of morality
  - grab two glasses in hand and make sure they don't touch each other and make noise

15.  How to turn negatives into positives and get a positive reaction from anything
  - vocalise the likely thoughts of the audience
  - vocalise the strain on your cloth, or any distraction
    - you get a laugh and it becomes normalized behavior that we are all conscious of on wego
  - always acknowledge the obvious
    - girl started crying before your speech
      - acknowledge her courage, strength and emotional fall

16.  How to 10X your delivery with very little effor
  - adding acto (add ACT OUT)
    - doing anything to bring what you are delivering to life
    - moving hands a little bit in case of fight scene in your story
    - raise eyebrow or looks like a weirdo
    - expression of your parents or change your voice
    - sneaky dance moves
    - hand, face expressions bring your stories to life

17.  My own act out attempts
  - change your voice even slightly to show another character and speak in the present tense
  - work in via tangents any talents you have for language, dance and so on
  - remember this is mostlyh a technique for big stages

18.  How to deliver key points
  - pace of your speech depends on your easiness or comfort level
    - as long as you stop and stand still for the key points and make it concise

19.  How to short cut preparation time
  - practice in fast forward (fast speed speeches) to know where you are forgetting
  - another short cut (Memory Palace)
    - memorize the first 30 off by heart
    - memorize the closing
    - memorize our work through and give a quick run
    - just record it and watch it back

20.  How to have the best possible finish: Never end with Q&A
  - Going to take few question before I make my conclusion (else we will never get out of here)

21.  How to avoid ever going over your time limit
  - Don't run the clock
  - Have a timer already in front of you to know the time limit
  - audience prefer lunch over the talk

22.  How to work in callbacks for huge audience reactions
  - see something unique in the event
  - something weird mentioned 
  - something relevant said earlier
  - always watch the 3 previous speakers

23.  How to win over the audience
  - Find out about the people who are attending and the place itself
  - humor works in all culture if you change some key words referencing to that culture although keeping the plot same

24.  How to evaluate your own performance and improve fast
  - most important one and probably the most painful one
  - consciously listen to recording and analyze what worked and what didn't work
  - serves a great purpose of giving you a bit of peace of mind

25.  Assignment 2: Evaluate my story
  - Have a hero/protagonist
  - Have a change
  - Add twists/turns and tangents to the story
  - have some stakes
  - start in the action
  - write the last lines first
  - start strong/first 30 seconds
  - local references
  - rule of 3
  - compare and contrast
  - wrap it up
  - acknowledge the obvious
  - lots of laugh lines

26.  Assignment: List to yourself
  - Find a space at home or work and tell at least one of your stories while recording them. This can be audio or video recorded. Video is better if possible but anything is better than nothing! Do not stop to make corrections. This is where you vocalise thoughts and let your mind wander. You will be surprised what little additions you tend to make compared to your writing.

    Listen back to see if you made any additions worth keeping and also identify where you can cut out words. If your story makes you laugh even a little on listening back then you have something good to work with. If you love telling a story its likely others will love to listen.

    Transcribe the file and rewrite what you like best following the Joke Structure outlined earlier.

28.  Assignment: Evaluation and permanent beta
  - Watch this TED talk by Mary Roach (https://www.ted.com/talks/mary_roach_10_things_you_didn_t_know_about_orgasm)

    Apply the 1-5 scoring scale system to it to get a feel for the process and calculate the laughs per minute. (Count the number of laughs and divide it by the total talk time).

    *It's a really great talk and you might struggle to give any content lower numbers but it's a fun one to watch and at least try it with.

    Now look at your own content, whether this is from a past talk or presentation or one you plan to give. Whether you were practicing recording yourself, on friends, family, colleagues, or conferences give it a score.

    If you have audio or video from a delivery to a live or virtual audience identify which parts led to the best reactions. This also works well for identifying interest levels. Which parts led to confused looks, questions or had people on the edge of their seats.

    What worked?

    What did't?

    What content can be cut?

    Score it on a scale of 1 to 5. Try and cut 1's and 2's and improve 3's.

    Find the content that gets the highest ratings consistently. Look to extract your most engaging stories, most shared or commented on content, best opening lines, and best closing lines. You are constantly trying to improve and refine this process.
