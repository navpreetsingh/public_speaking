4. Start with an anecdote, end with the data
  - Anecdote (Build excitement) => Conflict (question intuition) => Data (resolve conflict)
  - Anecdotes grab attention and arouse curiosity, and are great tools for data presentations. However, anecdotes might not reflect general trends, and therefore should be used only if you follow the anecdote with a more complete dataset.

5. Build suspense, not surprise
