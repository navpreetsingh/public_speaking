    **TENSION EXAMPLE IN GOODFELLAS**

    Use what you learned in chapter 2 about tension and watch this epic scene from Goodfellas (talk about a rubber band being pulled in multiple directions!). How many different types of tension can you identify in this scene? – bonus points for editor Thelma Schoomaker for cutting the most tense car braking montage ever – it’s only 2 seconds long but milks it for tension.

    **“THE SANDWICH GENERATION” – My 4 minute award-winning podcast submission to KCRW’s 24 hour radio race (from Chapter 2 - "How to Start")**

    KCRW is a great public radio station in Los Angeles – every year they announce a theme on a Saturday at noon, then by Sunday at noon, creators have to deliver a <4min podcast around that theme. Last year, the announced the theme (“THE NEW NORMAL”) and out of a few hundred submissions, I was lucky to win! I credit tension with the ability to create a story under a deadline – always thinking “how can I evoke a question to form in my audience’s mind and withholding the payoff?”
